Simple Bar Charter - CLI to generate SVG bar charts

simpleBarCharter.sh, sbc, is Copyright 2014 by Mark S. Kalusha, msk.

This program produces a simple bar chart in SVG format, given command line 
inputs, values passed by the user. 

The minimal input is a list of integers, i.e:
$ ./sbc "1 1 2 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377"

For more information see the USAGE comments in simpleBarCharter.sh

NOTE: Up until version 0.0.9 this utility was called,
      makeXRectsOfWidthW-givenListOfYRectHeights.sh
      Originally the SVG sbcTemplates where a little simpler and were not kept
      is a sub-directory.
